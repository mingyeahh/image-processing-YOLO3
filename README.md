# Future Autonomous Vehicles: Better Quality Data through Image Pre-Processing


## Description

The project is an image processing coursework, which is built for image detection performance enhancement. 
transform.py is for image enhancement specifically for corrupted images with noise and strong contrast and brightness.

## Getting Started


### Executing program

* Input of the program transform.py is a set of images.

* The path to input is on line 10, users will need to set their own path to read the images. For example:

```
path_to_dataset = "path/to/imagedir"
```

* Output of the program transform.py is a video made of a set of modified images and the directory with modified images in. 

* The path to the output directory is on line 11, users will need to set their own path to store the output images after image processing. For example:
```
path_to_out = "path/to/outputdir"
```
